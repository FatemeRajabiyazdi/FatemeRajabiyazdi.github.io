                                I ran activities asking students to critique 
                                sample visualization designs and sketch new

                                running hands-on activities will create a more active

                                offered this course for the first time and because of 
                                my previous experience with teaching other data science and 
                                analytics courses, I was invited to tutor for this course. 
                                I outlined all the course assignments and helped the instructor
                                 in designing the course projects. I have designed and 
                                 delivered materials and activities for two 3-hour tutorial sessions weekly.  During the tutorials, 
                                I grouped the students and led them for their course projects with weekly feedback. <br>

                                I taught students how to conduct interviews with stakeholders of a project, identify the
                                requirements of the projects, the system tasks, 
                                as well as coding with C# and WPF languages. For this course,
                                 I was responsible for leading the projects of ten groups of 
                                 students where each group had 4 students during the semester. 
                                 I guided students through the entire cycle of task-centered 
                                 system design technique to design and evaluate interfaces based on real-world tasks. 
                                 Mentoring student groups involved helping students scope their projects, helping 
                                 with technical problems, regular meetings with students to discuss problems and 
                                 suggest possible alternatives to improve interface design. 
                                Finally, I evaluated the projects through review of their portfolios and final
